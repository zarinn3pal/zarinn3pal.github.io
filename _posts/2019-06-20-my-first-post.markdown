Starting today I have decided to make blogging a part of my weekly routine.I have had a jekyll hosted site already but hasn't posted much. This will be the main platform where I will be expressing myself. 

Let's begin the journey by printing hello blogging on the language of my choice, which happens to be ruby now. 
{% highlight ruby %}
def greet(name)
  puts "Welcome to the world of blogging, #{name}"
end
greet('Niraj')
#=> prints 'Welcome to the world of blogging, Niraj' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
